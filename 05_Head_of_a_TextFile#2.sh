#Objective
#In this challenge, we practice using the head command to display the first nn characters of a text file.

#Resources
#By default, it displays the first 1010 lines when used in the form:

#head [filename]
#head -n 11 [filename]  -> First 11 lines
#head -c 20 [filename]  -> First 20 characters
#Since we will provide the text files via STDIN the filename may be ignored.

#We can also specify a certain number of lines to be displayed and list multiple filenames as well. It may also be used to display a specified number of bytes from an input file. Click here for more details about using the head command.
