#Objective
#In this challenge, we practice using the uniq command to eliminate consecutive repetitions of a line when a text file is piped through it.

#Plain Uniq

#If this is the file test.txt:

#00
#00
#01
#01
#00
#00
#02
#02
#This is the output on passing it through the uniq command, either via pipes or as input via STDIN:

#Command:  uniq < test.txt

#00
#01
#00
#02
#The first two lines of the original file are the same, (00)(00). The next two lines are (01)(01) which are followed by two repetitions of (00)(00) again and two repetitions of (02)(02). The uniq command replaces the consecutive repetitions with only one line in each case.

#Uniq with counts

#uniq -c < test.txt
#This example indicates the count of repetitions for each of the lines it collapses.

#If this is the test file, testCounts.txt:

#00
#00
#01
#01
#00
#00
#02
#02
#03
#aa
#aa
#aa

#Command: uniq -c < input00.txt

#      2 00
#      2 01
#      2 00
#      2 02
#      1 03
#      3 aa
#The first number is the count of the repeated occurrences in the original file.

#Printing only duplicate lines

#The -d option only prints those lines that are followed by one or more repetitions immediately after them:

#uniq -d < testCounts.txt
#OR

#cat testCounts.txt | uniq -d
#OR

#uniq -d testCounts.txt
#Printing only unique lines

#The -u option only prints those lines that are succeeded and preceded by different lines:

#uniq -u < testCounts.txt
#OR

#cat testCounts.txt | uniq -u
#OR

#uniq -u testCounts.txt

#Other possible options:

#Limit comparison only to the first NN characters (using the -w option).
#Avoid comparing the first NN characters (using the -s option).
#Ignore variations in case between lines (using the -i option).
#Avoid comparing the first NN fields (using the -f option).
#(This may be useful while processing TSV files when you'd like to ignore the first column if it has serial numbers.)
#You might find these examples interesting and useful.

#Task
#Given a text file, remove the consecutive repetitions of any line.

#Sample Input:
#00
#00
#01
#01
#00
#00
#02
#02

#Sample Output:
#00
#01
#00
#02

#SUBMISSION:
